# Instructions
Use the command `python3 main.py <formula_file_name> <proofs_file_name>` to print the output...  
`data/proof1.txt` and `data/proof2.txt` both are correct resolution computations, whereas `data/proof3.txt` is incorrect one.  
I have assumed if the last clause is not empty then the proof is incorrect, as mentioned in the class.
